### Functions

#### Methods `asset() → address assetTokenAddress`  Visibility:  external

- MUST NOT revert.


**Outputs:**
| Type | Name |
| ---- | ---- |
| address | assetTokenAddress |




#### Methods `totalAssets() → uint256 totalManagedAssets`  Visibility:  external

#### Methods `convertToShares(uint256 assets) → uint256 shares`  Visibility:  external

**Description**: Returns the amount of shares that the Vault would exchange for the amount of assets provided, in an ideal
scenario where all the conditions are met.

- MUST NOT be inclusive of any fees that are charged against assets in the Vault.
- MUST NOT show any variations depending on the caller.
- MUST NOT reflect slippage or other on-chain conditions, when performing the actual exchange.
- MUST NOT revert.

NOTE: This calculation MAY NOT reflect the “per-user” price-per-share, and instead should reflect the
“average-user’s” price-per-share, meaning what the average user should expect to see when exchanging to and
from.

**Arguments:**
| Type | Name |
| ---- | ---- |
| uint256 | assets |

- MUST NOT show any variations depending on the caller.
- MUST NOT reflect slippage or other on-chain conditions, when performing the actual exchange.
- MUST NOT revert.

#### Methods `maxDeposit(address receiver) → uint256 maxAssets`  Visibility:  external

**Description**: Returns the maximum amount of the underlying asset that can be deposited into the Vault for the receiver,

**Description**: Allows an on-chain or off-chain user to simulate the effects of their deposit at the current block, given

- MUST return as close to and no more than the exact amount of Vault shares that would be minted in a deposit
  call in the same transaction. I.e. deposit should return the same or more shares as previewDeposit if called
  in the same transaction.

  deposit would be accepted, regardless if the user has enough tokens approved, etc.
- MUST be inclusive of deposit fees. Integrators should be aware of the existence of deposit fees.
- MUST NOT revert.

NOTE: any unfavorable discrepancy between convertToShares and previewDeposit SHOULD be considered slippage in
share price or some other type of condition, meaning the depositor will lose assets by depositing.

  deposit execution, and are accounted for during deposit.
- MUST revert if all of assets cannot be deposited (due to deposit limit being reached, slippage, the user not
  approving enough underlying tokens to the Vault contract, etc).

NOTE: most implementations will require pre-approval of the Vault with the Vault’s underlying asset token.
