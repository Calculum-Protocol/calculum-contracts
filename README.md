# Calculum Vault

Calculum v1 is the first version our Vault, based on ERC4626, with several improvement and adaptation

v1 changes include:

- Full compliance with ERC-4626
- Some improven of security
- Gas Cost improvement
- Integration with Trader Bot, API in the Unit-Test

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies with yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

Next, we need to populate the .env file with these values.\
Copy the .env.example -> .env and fill out the value.\
Reach out to the team if you need help on these variables. The `TEST_URI` needs to be an archive node.

```bash
MNEMONIC=
INFURAKEY=
PRIVATE_KEY=
DEPLOYER_ADDRESS=
COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY=
BSCSCAN_API_KEY=
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=
POLYGON_API_KEY=
ALCHEMY_KEY=
HTTP_HOST_TESTNET = https://api.stage.dydx.exchange
WS_HOST_TESTNET = wss://api.stage.dydx.exchange/v3/ws
ACCOUNTS=
```

Can run the Build of contracts

```bash
# Run all the tests
yarn build
```

Finally, we can run the tests in Hardhat:

```bash
# Run all the tests
yarn test
```

## Deployment

Calculum Vault V1 uses [hardhat-deploy](https://github.com/wighawag/hardhat-deploy) to manage contract deployments to the blockchain.

To deploy all the contracts in the Testnet for Short Support of ethereum forum to Sepolia, do

```
yarn deploy:sepolia
```

To deploy all the contracts in the Testnet for long Support of ethereum forum to Goerli, do

```
yarn deploy:testnet
```

## Testing

Will run all tests on Ethereum fork-mainnet based on Alchemy RPC

```
yarn test
```

Runs local Own Ethereum Node (Hardhat Local Node)

```
yarn test-local
```

### Getting Started

 * Use Foundry:
```bash
forge install
forge test
```

### Features

 * Write / run tests with either Hardhat or Foundry:
```bash
forge test
#Â or
npx hardhat test
```

 * Use Hardhat's task framework
```bash
npx hardhat example
```

 * Install libraries with Foundry which work with Hardhat.
```bash
forge install rari-capital/solmate # Already in this repo, just an example
```

### Notes

Whenever you install new libraries using Foundry, make sure to update your `remappings.txt` file by running `forge remappings > remappings.txt`. This is required because we use `hardhat-preprocessor` and the `remappings.txt` file to allow Hardhat to resolve libraries you install with Foundry.
